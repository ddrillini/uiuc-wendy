# Pattern Reference Addendum

## Anchors

Any pattern where one foot stays on the same panel, while the other foot moves around

This example anchors on the left panel:

```
L
   R
L
  U
L
   R
L
 D
L
```

Side (i.e. left/right) anchors are generally more comfortable than down and (especially) up anchors. Unless it contains candles, a short anchor at 180 bpm or below is generally considered a comfortable stream pattern.

Some of Ian's Pendulum charts are infamous for having measure-long anchors.

## Drills/Towers

The same two arrows alternating

Drills generally imply a shorter but faster sequence (e.g. LRLRLRL as 24ths), whereas towers generally occur in the context of 16th stream.

Towers in particular are generally not considered comfortable.
